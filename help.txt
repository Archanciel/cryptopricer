Requesting RT and historical cryptocurrency prices

Full request
------------

<crypto> <fiat> <date time> <exchange>
<date time>:	0 for RT
			21/12 or 21/12/17
			21/12 8:34
			Warning: specifying time only makes sense for dates not older than 7 days. Prices older than 7 days are 'close' prices. Since there is no notion of a close price for crypto's, the last price of the date at UTC 23.59 is returned as 'close' price.

Ex: 	btc usd 0 bittrex --> 
	BTC/USD on BitTrex: 16/12/17 22:10R 19120

	eth btc 16/12 13:45 bitfinex --> 
	ETH/BTC on Bitfinex: 16/12/17M 0.03893

	eth btc 21/1 13:45 bitfinex --> 
	ETH/BTC on Bitfinex: 21/01/17C 0.01185

	R = RT
	M = Minute price (precision at the minute)
	C = Close price

Partial request
---------------

Once a full request has been entered, it is handy to just change one or more parameters of the initial command. The app keeps and reuses the parameters which are not redefined.

The partial request parameters are specified using the tokens

-c<crypto>
-f<fiat>
-d<date>
	<date> can be 0 for RT, dd/mm or dd/mm/yy or dd/mm/yyyy
-t<time>
	<time> format: hh:mm
-e<exchange>

Ex:	-fusd -->
	ETH/USD on Bittfinex: 21/01/17C 0.01185
