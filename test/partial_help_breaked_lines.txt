[b][cr]Requesting RT and historical cryptocurrency prices[/b][/c]

CryptoPricer supports two kinds of requests: full requests
and partial requests.

[b]Full request[/b]

<crypto> <unit> <date time> <exchange> <options>

<date time> possible values:

    [b][cy]0[/cy][/b] for RT

    [b][cy]21/12 or 21/12/19 or 21/12/2019[/c][/b]. If no year is specified,
    current year is assumed. If no time is specified, current
    time is assumed.

    [b][cy]21/12 8:34[/c][/b] --> current year assumed

    21 8:34 --> here, since no month is specified,
    current month or previous month is assumed.

    8:34 --> here, since no date is specified, current
    date is assumed.

[b]WARNING[/b]: specifying time makes sense only for dates not older than
7 days. Prices older than 7 days are 'close' prices. Since there is no notion
of a close price for crypto's, the last price of the date at UTC 23.59 is
returned as 'close' price.

[b]Output price qualifiers[/b]:

    R = RT

    M = Minute price (precision at the minute)

    C = Close price

Examples: assume we are on 16/12/17 at 22:10
